/**
 * Inspired by org.axonframework.springboot.util.ConditionalOnMissingQualifiedBean
 *
 * {@link Conditional} that only matches when for the specified bean class in the {@link BeanFactory} there is an
 * instance which has the given {@code qualifier} set on it.
 * <p>
 * The condition can only match the bean definitions that have been processed by the
 * application context so far and, as such, it is strongly recommended to use this
 * condition on auto-configuration classes only. If a candidate bean may be created by
 * another auto-configuration, make sure that the one using this condition runs after.
